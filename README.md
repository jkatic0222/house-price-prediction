# house-price-prediction

The project was made to test out predictions on the house market of Croatia by using a neural network.
The original data was scraped from "Nju≈°kalo" (www.njuskalo.hr), a website for advertising a lot of different things as well as real estate.
Since data was scraped on multiple dates there are a few .csv files on this project but the one used for the actual training of the neural network and predictions is data_njuskalo.csv which contains all the data.
